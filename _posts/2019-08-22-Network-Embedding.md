将数据转换为网络表示和从网络种提取潜在表示所面临的挑战.

## 网络潜入(网络节点表示，Network Embedding)


### Graph Embedding v.s. Network Embedding

Graphs exists in mathematics. (Data Structure)
Mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.

Network exist in the real world. (Data)
Social network, logistic network, biology network, transaction network, etc.

### Structed-preserved network embedding

How to define neighborhood in networks? Deepwalk.

Deepwalk preserve social relation in vector space.

### High-Order Proximity

Solve the sparsity problem of network connnections.

Measure indirect relationship between nodes.
