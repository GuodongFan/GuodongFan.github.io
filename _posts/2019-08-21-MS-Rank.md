`异常诊断`

## 目的

从micro-service 架构中分析多个度量指标.

MS-Rank has four phases: impact graph construction, random walk diagnosis, result precision calculation, and metrics weight update.

服务的缺陷偶尔会导致系统的异常状态. 当异常发生时找到原因是一个挑战性的任务，因为有太多的服务还有不同的指标的调查.


## Some Concepts 

An annomaly is observed in a frontend service $v_{fe}$ within a period $t_{interval}$ from services $V$ (We call other services as backend). The goal of this study is to identify a set of services $v_{rc} \subset V$ that cause the anomaly based on multiple kinds of collected metrics from $v_{fe}$ and other backend services. The study treats micro-service architecture as a black box.

## MS-Rank

专家通常通过服务的特性选用某种指标去派出故障. 比如，UI相关的服务会用latency. 计算相关的服务用吞吐量或者CPU的指标. 尽管服务调用的依赖经常变，但是微服务的功能性相对稳定.

The `idea` of the study is straightforward: instead of specifying certain kind of metric to services, we design a self-adaptive mechnanism, named MS-Rank, to update the confidence weight of metrics and dynamically choose them for diagnosis according to their historical diagnosis precision.

### Basic and Implied Metrics

一个指标并不能反应异常特征. 比如有些服务它就是延迟比较长.

Let $n$ be the number of services and $m$ be the number of different kinds of metrics, we denote the metric for service $v_i$ at the time $t$ as $M(v_i, t)=${$M_1(v_i, t), M_2(v_i, t), ..., M_m(v_i, t)$}, $i\in [1, n]$, where $M_j(v_i, t)$ stands for the value of No.$j$ metric for service $v_i$, or use $M_{j,t}(t)$ for short.

Gradient, Gradient Ratio and Laplacian evaluate and reflect the trends in metrics within a given interval [$t_{start}, t_{end}$].
