## Research question

Variance questions deal with difference and correlation. For example, "Do exemplary medical school teachers differ from others in their teaching of basic science".

Process questions, in contrast, focus on how and why things happen.

## Types of User Study

Exploratory study. The purpose of this type of study is `to seek new insights into some
phenomenon`, and generate ideas and hypotheses for new research, e.g., to find out what
programming concepts are difficult to learn by the beginners.

Confirmatory study. The purpose of this type of study is `to confirm the ideas or test theories
and hypotheses`, e.g., to confirm if the students should be taught object-oriented concepts
first before learning Java programming.

Explanatory study. This purpose of study aims `to explain problems of some phenomena
for future improvements`, e.g., to explain how developers in industry use UML diagrams
during software design.
