## Research question

Variance questions deal with difference and correlation. For example, "Do exemplary medical school teachers differ from others in their teaching of basic science".

Process questions, in contrast, focus on how and why things happen.

## Types of User Study

Exploratory study. The purpose of this type of study is `to seek new insights into some
phenomenon`, and generate ideas and hypotheses for new research, e.g., to find out what
programming concepts are difficult to learn by the beginners.

Confirmatory study. The purpose of this type of study is `to confirm the ideas or test theories
and hypotheses`, e.g., to confirm if the students should be taught object-oriented concepts
first before learning Java programming.

Explanatory study. This purpose of study aims `to explain problems of some phenomena
for future improvements`, e.g., to explain how developers in industry use UML diagrams
during software design.

## Review Plan
### Selecting Relevant Literature Databases
IEEE Xplore (ieeexplore.ieee.org)
ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com)
ACM DL (dl.acm.org)
SpringerLink (link.springer.com)

### Search Strings

S = ("service composition" OR mashup) AND "end user" AND "user study"
注意引擎的差异

### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
无论搜索字符串有多准确，返回的结果总是包含大量不相关的研究。因此定义一系列的标准确定其相关性或其他方面，并将相关研究的数量减少到可控制的规模。

## Conducting the Review

### Database Search

### Study Selection
根据标准筛选文献。

### Data Extraction

数据提取目的是获得可以有助于回答研究问题的所需数据。

步骤：
1. Read each selected study in detail to obtain an overall picture of the study.
2. Extract the descriptions from each study based on the eight components of our review framework.
3. Pull out the publication details of each study from the EndNote library.


### Data Synthesis and Analysis.

1. The data extracted from each study were sorted and aggregated into eight categories, corresponding to the eight review components.
2. Within each category, the data were sorted into different subcategories (types). For example, the data in the Study Goals category were classified into one of the Exploratory, Confirmatory and Explanatory subcategories; the data in the Data Collection Methods
category were divided into the Observation, Interview, Focus Group, and Questionnaire subcategories.
