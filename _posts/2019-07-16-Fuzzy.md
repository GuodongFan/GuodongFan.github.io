## Literature Review

### A QoS-based Fuzzy Model for Ranking Real WorldWeb Services,ICWS

可以使用fuzzy set处理用户不精确的偏好。


### On the Use of Fuzzy Dominance for Computing Service Skyline Based on QoS,ICWS

模糊帕累托支配

解决当前实现的如下不足：

需要用户给定QoS的权重。

bad compromise between QoS attributes; users usually prefer services that are (moderately) good in all QoS attributes.

the service SKyline approach does not allow users to control the size of the returned set of services.

个人观点，比较客观的去除被支配的服务（比客观权重排名还客观）。
